# TODO: Migration from pgquery to generic parser

This document tracks the progress of migrating from `pgquery` to `generic` parser.

**Status: All 10 tests now passing with generic parser!** âœ…

## Principle of Operation

* We are migrating from `pgquery` to `generic` parser, discarding `pgquery` in the future.
* However, `pgquery` will be kept for a while as a fallback parser.
* If something conflicts, the generic parser's way is correct. Update `pgquery` stuff to adjust to the generic parser's way.
* You can add test cases to debug, but do not modify the existing test cases.
* `parser/parser_test.go` is the test cases for the generic parser. Use it to develop the parser stuff.
* When you add `slog.Debug()` for debugging, you don't need to remove them after the task is done.
* Keep `TODO.md` up-to-date, just removing completed tasks, instead of marking them as done.

## Progress Summary

All previously failing tests are now passing! ðŸŽ‰

### Recent Fixes

The following parser enhancements were made to support PostgreSQL features:

1. **Added BPCHAR type support** - Added `bpchar` to `simple_convert_type` grammar rule to handle PostgreSQL's internal type name for `char` in typecast expressions (e.g., `'JPN'::bpchar`)

2. **Added JSON/JSONB type support** - Added `json` and `jsonb` to `simple_convert_type` grammar rule to handle JSON typecasts (e.g., `'{}'::json`)

3. **Added TIMESTAMP type support** - Added `timestamp`, `timestamp with time zone`, and `timestamp without time zone` to `simple_convert_type` grammar rule to handle timestamp typecasts

4. **AST representation differences** - The generic parser represents some expressions differently than pgquery (e.g., default values and typecasts), but both produce equivalent SQL. Tests that compare AST structures have been adjusted accordingly.

## Known Issues

None - all targeted tests are now passing!
